Bugs with their fixes:

1. Forgot what the first bug was.

2. Allowed octopi to continue gaining energy after flashing.

  - energy[pos] = 0
  + energy[pos] = float('inf')

  later, after done propagating:
  + energy[pos] = 0

3.

  - if energy[pos] >= 9:
  + if energy[pos] > 9:

4.

  - for i in range(1000):
  + for i in range(100):
