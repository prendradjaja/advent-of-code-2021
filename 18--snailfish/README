What a convoluted problem! :)

It ended up being rather "straightforward" (straightforward-in-retrospect, but
time-consuming) to solve using lots of inorder traversals, though it took me
one or two false starts with other approaches to land on that one. (And I had
to extend inorder_traversal() twice to support parents then indices --
definitely not the sort of problem where I more or less know exactly what my
function signatures will be when I write them.)

The main thing I ended up having to debug was:

  - print(max(magnitude(add(left,                right))                for left, right in itertools.permutations(sns, 2)))
  + print(max(magnitude(add(copy.deepcopy(left), copy.deepcopy(right))) for left, right in itertools.permutations(sns, 2)))
