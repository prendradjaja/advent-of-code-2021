What a convoluted problem! :)

It ended up being rather "straightforward" (straightforward but
time-consuming) to solve using lots of inorder traversals.


The main thing I ended up having to debug was:

  - print(max(magnitude(add(left,                right))                for left, right in itertools.permutations(sns, 2)))
  + print(max(magnitude(add(copy.deepcopy(left), copy.deepcopy(right))) for left, right in itertools.permutations(sns, 2)))
