24 possible orientations
26 beacons per scanner
37 scanners

5 scanners

x given two scanners, brute force to search for an overlap:
  every beacon from s1 * every beacon from s2 * every possible orientation of s2 * set intersection of beacons from both =
  26 * 26 * 24 * 52 = 800k

x given one scanner, brute force to find an overlapping scanner:
  every other scanner * brute force to search for an overlap:
  36 * 800k = 29m

. brute force every scanner:
  every scanner * brute force to find an overlapping scanner:
  37 * 29m = 1b

    . find relative positions i guess


'big-example' is:
  26 * 26 * 5 * 52 = 200k
  4 * 200 = 800k (36x smaller)
  4 * 800k = 3.2m (300x smaller)

  and it took 9 sec with no short-circuiting

  800k nodes / 9 sec = 100kn/sec

  1 billion nodes / (100kn/sec) = 10000 sec = 3 hours

  so i want a speedup of 6x in order to guarantee completion in half an hour
