def region_subtract(ra, rb):
    '''
    Subtract region B from region A, returning the parts of A that do not
    overlap with B.

    The result is a list of regions (which can be empty: specifically, if A
    overlaps entirely with B, then the result is an empty list).

        Example: A - B results in a list of three smaller regions C, D, E

        aaaaa        cceee
        aaaaa        cceee
        aa***bb  ->  dd.....
        aa***bb      dd.....
          bbbbb        .....

        * = overlap of A and B
        . = where B was (Included just for clarity. This is not present in the
            return value.)

        >>> a = ((1, 5), (1, 4))
        >>> b = ((3, 7), (3, 5))
        >>> c = ((1, 2), (1, 2))
        >>> d = ((1, 2), (3, 4))
        >>> e = ((3, 5), (1, 2))
        >>> region_subtract(a, b) == [c, d, e]
        True

    It would be possible to return an equivalent list with a smaller number of
    regions e.g. by fusing C and D or fusing C and E! This is not implemented.
